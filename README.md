# DeltaView

## Overview

DeltaView is a small C++/Qt application I built that compares two text inputs or files and highlights the differences between them. 
It provides a simple, side-by-side interface where I can paste or load text and instantly see what changed, making it a quick and lightweight tool for checking edits or revisions.

## Environment

- Visual Studio 2022
- C++ 20
- Qt 6
